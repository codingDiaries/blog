###### Git

Hey guys in this blog we're going to take a look at git. This is meant to be a no nonsense guide for beginners who are new or intermediate programmers or developers that either don't know what git is or have used it briefly but still don't really grasp the full concept.

### What is git

Git is it's a version control system for tracking changes in computer files. It was initially created in
2005 by Linus Torvalds who was also the creator of Linux there's no specific language or framework or anything that you need to use git you can use it for static HTML web sites node.js apps, Python,
Java, c-sharp anything at all it just stores files.

#### Git is a distributed version control system

Git is a distributed version control system or decentralized version control system and what that means is that many developers can work on a single project without having to be on the same network. So there's also version control systems that developers actually need to be on the same network to use.

#### Coordinates work between multiple developers

Git coordinates work between multiple developers and attracts every single version and every single change that's made on the system or on the in the project

#### you can also revert back to specific versions

you can also revert back to specific versions of any file at any time as long as it was committed to the repository. When you use git you'll have a repository on your local machine that you work on you make changes and then you upload it to a remote repository like github or bitbucket.  
 You don't need an internet connection to work on a repository locally and you can make changes but if you want to push it to the remote repository you will need an internet connection.

Git essentially keeps track of your code history with snapshots of your files.You make these snapshots by making a commitment and you can always go back to see any snapshot of previously written code and
like I said you can always revert back if you need to so your code is extremely safe when you're working with git you
